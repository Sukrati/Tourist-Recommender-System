## Tourist-Recommender-System

# Objective
Aim to develop a personalized travel planning system that simultaneously considers all categories of user requirements and provides users with a travel schedule planning service.This will enable the user in finding what they are looking for, easily without spending time and effort.
The recommender system will filter irrelevant options and provide personalised and relevant information to each particular user, matching the characteristics of tourism attractions,hotels etc. with the user needs. This also takes into consideration the distance of each tourist attraction from the userâ€™s location and provides the recommendations accordingly.
